[![CI](https://github.com/bopen/leaflet-area-selection/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bopen/leaflet-area-selection/actions/workflows/main.yml)

The primary target of this plugin is to obtain a **customizable selected area** while keeping **high usability**.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @bopen/leaflet-area-selection
```

## Usage

```javascript
import L from 'leaflet';
import '@bopen/leaflet-area-selection/dist/index.css';
import { DrawAreaSelection } from '@bopen/leaflet-area-selection';

const map = L.map('root').setView([41.901493, 12.5009157], 13);

L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
  attribution:
    '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors',
}).addTo(map);

const areaSelection = new DrawAreaSelection();

map.addControl(areaSelection);
```

### Old school usage?

Although we think it's time for Leaflet to move away from global `L` object and open to modern JavaScript and tree-shaking, you can still use this plugin in the old way.

This gist contains a modified version of the Leaflet "Hello World" example: https://gist.github.com/keul/74e442b96a41c4f50e304c22259a63c3

## Configuration

The `DrawAreaSelection` can receive a configuration object with followings supported options:

- `active` - the plugin starts as active, no need to run it from the button
- `fadeOnActivation` - when actively drawing a new area the map is partially faded out
- `onPolygonReady` - callback called during the adjustment phase (see below) every time a change is performed to the polygon (vertex moved, added or removed).<br>
  Receives the [Leaflet.Polygon](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#polygon) and the control instance as arguments.
- `onPolygonDblClick` - called when performing a double-click on the draw polygon when in the adjustment phase (see below).<br>
  Receives three arguments: the [Leaflet.Polygon](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#polygon), the control instance and the event.
- `onButtonActivate` - called when user clicks on the button to enable draw a polygon.<br>
  Receives two arguments: the control instance and the event. Calling `preventDefault` on the event will abort the activation.
- `onButtonDeactivate` - called when user clicks on the button to stop drawing the polygon.<br>
  Receives three arguments: the [Leaflet.Polygon](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#polygon), the control instance and the event.
  Calling `preventDefault` on the event will abort the deactivation.

A polygon can be drawn on the map at loading time (it can later be changed by the user) by firing the "point-add" multiple times on the map as in the example script below:

```javascript
const brect = map.getContainer().getBoundingClientRect();

let point_1 = map.latLngToContainerPoint(45,5]);
map.fire("as:point-add",
  new MouseEvent("click", {
    clientX: point_1.x + brect.left,
    clientY: point_1.y + +brect.top
  })
);

let point_2 = map.latLngToContainerPoint(46,6]);
map.fire("as:point-add",
  new MouseEvent("click", {
    clientX: point_2.x + brect.left,
    clientY: point_2.y + +brect.top
  })
);

let point_3 = map.latLngToContainerPoint(47,7]);
map.fire("as:point-add",
  new MouseEvent("click", {
    clientX: point_3.x + brect.left,
    clientY: point_3.y + +brect.top
  })
);

#Now closing by coming back to point 1
map.fire("as:point-add",
  new MouseEvent("click", {
    clientX: point_1.x + brect.left,
    clientY: point_1.y + +brect.top
  })
);
```

## User guide

### Defining the skeleton of the polygon

When the plugin is activated by using the new control, the map enters in a **drawing phase**.<br>
Clicks on the map will trigger the creation of a vertex for the polygon.

User can continue adding vertexes to the polygon (min length is 3) until the whole required area is covered.<br>
To complete the polygon drawing phase user must click on the first (green) point created.

Alternatively: on the first click you can drag&drop and directly create a square shape (_note_: this method is not currently working on mobile!).

### Fix and change polygon shape

At this point we enter the **adjustment phase**, where user can:

- move edges of the polygon by dragging them
- create new edges, by dragging the ghost markers in the middle of every path
- deleting edges by double clicking on them
